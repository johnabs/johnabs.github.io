I’m a Graduate Research Assistant in the Mario Ventresca group at Purdue University. My academic interests cover a wide area, but are succinctly summarized as interest in complex systems, optimization, automated design, and system dynamics. I’m also a co-founder/CTO in an environmental startup called Evergreen: a service designed to provide environmental "nutrition facts", such as global warming potential and human impact, for every product so we can help consumers make more environmentally conscious purchases.

My hobbies include cooking/baking, keeping up with meme culture, woodworking, playing with my dog, spending too much time programming, and playing the occasional FromSoft game when I can squeak it in.
